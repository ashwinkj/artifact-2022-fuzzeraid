## Introduction
This repository holds the artifacts generated for/during the evaluation of ASE 2022 Paper: “FuzzerAid: Grouping Fuzzed
Crashes Based On Fault Signatures”. The environment and code required to replicate/re-use these artifacts are not
present in this repository.

### Input
This folder contains the _Crash Corpus_ generated using AFL's _Crash Exploration Mode_ and the minimal patch we
distilled from the developers patch. Each input is labeled as `<Bug-ID>_<AFL-Crash-ID>`. The patches are similarity
named as `p<Bug-ID>`.

| Folder Name  | Contains                                                                       |
| :---:        | :---                                                                           |
| Crash_Corpus | The crash corpus used as input for **FuzzerAid** each benchmark                |
| Patches      | The minimal patch that is used for determining the ground truth for each input |

### Baseline
This folder contains the deduplicated crashes and the grouping made using the patches. The deduplicated crashes produced
by BFF and HonggFuzz are not tied to individual Bug ID. For AFL, the deduplicated crashes have the format
`Bug-ID_<AFL-Crash-ID>`. All the baselines have `<Baseline-Setting>-patch-<Bug-ID>` file that shows the ground truth
computed for the bug with `<Bug-ID>` with the patch `p-<Bug-ID>`.

| AFL         | Unique crashes reported after `afl-cmin` along with ground truth classification                                           |
| BFF-1       | Unique crashes reported after running **CERT-BFF** with `backtracelevel=1` along with ground truth ground classification  |
| BFF-5       | Unique crashes reported after running **CERT-BFF** with `backtracelevel=5` along with ground truth ground classification  |
| HonggFuzz   | Unique crashes reported after running **HonggFuzz** with instrumentation along with ground truth ground classification    |
| HonggFuzz-S | Unique crashes reported after running **HonggFuzz** without instrumentation along with ground truth ground classification |


### Output
This folder contains the _Fault Signatures_ generated by **FuzzerAid** for each benchmark from _Generate Fault
Signatures_ process of our algorithm. It also contains the labeling for crash corpus with _Fault Signatures_ generated
during the _Classify with Fault Signatures_ phase and the final grouping produced in _Merge Fault Signatures_ phase.

| AFL         | List of _Fault Signatures_, _Fault Groups_ and _Fuzzed Crashes_ for AFL                                          |
| BFF         | List of _Fault Signatures_, _Fault Groups_ and _Fuzzed Crashes_ for BFF-1 and BFF-5 (combined results)           |
| HonggFuzz   | List of _Fault Signatures_, _Fault Groups_ and _Fuzzed Crashes_ for HonggFuzz and HonggFuzz-S (combined results) |
| FuzzerAid   | _Fault Signatures_ generated by **FuzzerAid**                                                                    |

The _Fault Signatures_ for each benchmark are under the folder “FuzzerAid”. It follows the file name format of
`<Bug-ID_AFL-Crash-ID>/myTest.c`, where `<Bug-ID_AFL-Crash-ID>` is the original crash used to generate the _Fault
Signature_ and `myTest.c` is the source code for _Fault Signatures_.

AFL, BFF and HonggFuzz folders contains the following files:

| File Name         | Contains                                                                                                 |
| :---:             | :---                                                                                                     |
| Fault_Groups.txt  | Fault Groups used for classifying each known bug along with the number inputs classified with each group |
| Fault_Sigs.txt    | Fault Signatures generated for each know bug by **FuzzerAid** during the classification                  |
| FuzzedCrashes.txt | The crash corpus labeled with Fault Signatures                                                           |

Since the deduplicated crashes produced by BFF and HonggFuzz are not tied to their `Bug-ID`, please cross-reference with
_Baseline_ folder's `p-<Bug-ID>` for getting individual `<Baseline-Setting>`'s classification. For example, the `19`
_Fault Groups_ for `Bug 5` for `sqlite` in `Output/sqlite/BFF/Fault_Groups.txt` is a combination of `5` from
`Baseline/BFF-1/BFF-1-patch-05.txt` (reported under `BFF-1` in Table 2) and `14` from `Baseline/BFF-5/BFF-5-patch-05.txt` (reported under `BFF-5` in Table 2). Similarly, `2` from `Baseline/HonggFuzz/HonggFuzz-default-patch-05.txt` and `3` from `Baseline/HonggFuzz-S/HonggFuzz-S-patch-05.txt` are reported under `HonggFuzz` and `HonggFuzz-S` in Table 2, respectively.
